###About Myself:
I graduated from Novosibirsk State University. I have a master's degree in energy. 

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
